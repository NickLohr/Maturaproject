            <p class = "hero-text">This is a very obvious and undangerous manipulation. But we get manipulated every day by big cooperations which hire huges marketing teams to find the right slogen and the most efficient method to get you to bux there product. This advertisments are happening since decades, but now with smartphones and an overflow of information just laying around it got possible to target specific people in the most derect way. While scrolling through Instagram we often don't even recognize the adds first.</p>
            <p class = "hero-text">The worst thing is, we not only get manipulated by addvertisments but also by our information source. Most people if they want to know something they use Google to find it out. But this search engines can control what gets returned on every search. Therefor you find what they want you to find.</p>
            <p class = "hero-text">Of course since many hunderst of years when not allready since the beginning we are manipulated by our suroundings, our teachers, friends and family members, but with this targeted advertisment of companies it got exponteielly more extrem and nearly impossible to oversee and avoid. </p>
