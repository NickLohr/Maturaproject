            <p class="hero-text">There are a lot of options how you can improve your privacy on the web. Most of them just need a few click to install and afterward you barly notice them. Sometimes it is important to read the AGBs but who has time or motivation to do that anyway, right?</p>
            <p class="hero-text">There are different options how you can find out if the AGB is ok or not. I use <a href="https://tosdr.org/"">TOSDR</a>. This have done for me a good job, but of course not every website is in there.

            <p class="hero-text">Google is often called as one of the big companies collecting our data about tied with Facebook. There is a simple alternative to Google. Its called duckduckgo.com, I start to use it and I got less adds (especially no hidden adds), found more excect what I was looking for and I was more private then ever. Our school recommends either duckduckgo or startpage.com which is google without the tracking and profiling.</p>
