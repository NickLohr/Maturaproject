            <h2 class="hero-title">Hacking your Data</h2>
            <p class="hero-text">Nowaday everyone leaves some traces behind online. But they feel mostly secure because of all the encryption and other security messuraments which are in place. They expect that there has to be a hacker to find out infromations about them and who would care about them and there little infromations. </p>
            <p class="hero-text">What most people sadly don't recognize, is that many informations are hidden in unencrypted open metadata. With this metadata which is produced nearly everytime you use your phone and a few other points it is possible to find out information about you, which you never put online. This infos are just educated guesses and are sometimes wrong, but for big cooperations it doesn't matter if it is wrong for these few procent. I got a ""% accuracy, imagine what google can do with so many more data and employees. </p>
            <p class="hero-text">So to find your address or your social status there is no hacking needed. It is done with "Big Data". In short, in Big Data one takes a lot of data (thats why its called big data) and looks for hidden information. Like depending on how often you use your phone and at what moments it is possible guess what profession you have. Combined with a lot more data they can collect a lot of information about anyone without them realizing it. </p>
            <p class="hero-text">To proove how simple such a profile can be created, I tried it myself. To see the information I got about you just try the  <a href="Demo">demo</a></p>
            <p class="hero-text">If you want to read more about it and are curious how to protect yourself of the profiling and the useless giving away of data I recommend you to read  <a href="LinksTipps">Tipps & Links</a></p>
